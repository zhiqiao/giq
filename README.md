General Information Quiz (GIQ)

This is a pet project as I'm learning Go (and to a lesser extent, App Engine).

* Background on GIQ
A "GIQ" or "General Information Quiz" was a weekly tradition during the school
year for students of a certain well-respected US History teacher in the South
Jersey area.  It consisted of a series (usually 10) questions about all manner
of trivia and knowledge.  The scores did not count for anything, but did serve
as a fun diverse in an otherwise...intense course load.

* Purpose of the App
(as of 2015-02-27)
- Allow creation of quizzes
- Allow taking of quizzes (both anonymously and logged in)
- For logged in users:
  - Record their scores for a given quiz
  - Store historical scores for comparison and analysis
