Queires
==================================================

Eventually we'll want to be able to answer some queries on the data generated.
Here are some proposed queries.  The datastore should be set up in such a way
as to easily answer these (or at least allow indices which do).

1. All Users
  i.   Top user results of most recent quiz
  ii.  Top recent user results (1 week)
  iii. Top user results of all time
  iv.  Top user averages (min 10 quizzes)
  v.   Top user response rate per category (min 10 questions)
  vi.  Top user averages by graduating class (min 10 quizzes)
3. Meta-analysis of Questions
  i.   Most common categories
  ii.  Response rate per category
2. Per-user
  i.   Personal average
  ii.  Personal history
  iii. Personal top categories
  iv.  Personal rank overall
  v.   Personal rank by class
